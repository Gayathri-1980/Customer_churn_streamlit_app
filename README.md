# Customer Churn Prediction App (ML + Streamlit)

A full end-to-end machine learning web application built with **Logistic Regression**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Streamlit**. It predicts whether a customer is likely to churn based on their demographic and service details.

This project includes:
✔️ Synthetic dataset generation  
✔️ Training pipeline  
✔️ Feature scaling  
✔️ Saved model artifacts  
✔️ Fully deployed Streamlit UI

## Project Summary
The goal is to estimate customer churn probability for telecom customers based on features like income, tenure, and support calls. The model is deployed as an interactive web app.

You can adjust inputs using sliders and instantly view:
- Churn prediction  
- Probability gauge meter  
- Feature importance  
- KPI metrics
